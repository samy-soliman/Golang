Channels Review

Here are a few extra things you should understand about channels from Dave Cheney's awesome article.

1- A send to a nil channel blocks forever

var c chan string // c is nil
c <- "let's get started" // blocks

2- A receive from a nil channel blocks forever

var c chan string // c is nil
fmt.Println(<-c) // blocks

3- A send to a closed channel panics

var c = make(chan int, 100)
close(c)
c <- 1 // panic: send on closed channel

4- A receive from a closed channel returns the zero value immediately

var c = make(chan int, 100)
close(c)
fmt.Println(<-c) // 0
