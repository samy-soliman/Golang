/*
while channels and goroutines are separate concepts in Go, they are designed to work together and are often tied together in practice.
It’s this combination of goroutines and channels that allows Go to handle concurrency so effectively.
*/

/*
Channels are a typed, thread-safe queue.
Channels allow different goroutines to communicate with each other.

Create a channel
Like maps and slices, channels must be created before use. They also use the same make keyword:
ch := make(chan int)

Send data to a channel
ch <- 69

The <- operator is called the channel operator.
Data flows in the direction of the arrow.
This operation will block until another goroutine is ready to receive the value.

Receive data from a channel
v := <-ch

This reads and removes a value from the channel and saves it into the variable v.
This operation will block until there is a value in the channel to be read.

Blocking and deadlocks
A deadlock is when a group of goroutines are all blocking so none of them can continue.
This is a common bug that you need to watch out for in concurrent programming.

/*
Empty structs are often used as tokens in Go programs.
In this context, a token is a unary value. In other words, we don't care what is passed through the channel. We care when and if it is passed.

We can block and wait until something is sent on a channel using the following syntax
<-ch

This will block until it pops a single item off the channel, then continue, discarding the item.
