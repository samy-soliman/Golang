Structs in Go

We use structs in Go to represent structured data. It's often convenient to group different types of variables together. For example, if we want to represent a car we could do the following:

type car struct {
  Make string
  Model string
  Height int
  Width int
}

This creates a new struct type called car. All cars have a Make, Model, Height and Width.

In Go, you will often use a struct to represent information that you would have used a dictionary for in Python

The fields of a struct can be accessed using the dot . operator.

myCar := car{}
myCar.FrontWheel.Radius = 5

when you declare a struct, the fields within it are initialized to their zero values. These zero values depend on the data type of each field
*/

/*
An anonymous struct is just like a normal struct, but it is defined without a name and therefore cannot be referenced elsewhere in the code.

To create an anonymous struct, just instantiate the instance immediately using a second pair of brackets after declaring the type:

	myCar := struct {
	  Make string
	  Model string
	} {

	  Make: "tesla",
	  Model: "model 3",
	}

You can even nest anonymous structs as fields within other structs:

	type car struct {
	  Make string
	  Model string
	  Height int
	  Width int
	  // Wheel is a field containing an anonymous struct
	  Wheel struct {
	    Radius int
	    Material string
	  }
	}

When should you use an anonymous struct?

In general, prefer named structs. Named structs make it easier to read and understand your code, and they have the nice side-effect of being reusable.

If a struct is only meant to be used once, then it makes sense to declare it in such a way that developers down the road wonâ€™t be tempted to accidentally use it again.

/*
While Go is not object-oriented, it does support methods that can be defined on structs. Methods are just functions that have a receiver. A receiver is a special parameter that syntactically goes before the name of the function.

type rect struct {
  width int
  height int
}

// area has a receiver of (r rect)
func (r rect) area() int {
  return r.width * r.height
}

r := rect{
  width: 5,
  height: 10,
}

fmt.Println(r.area())
// prints 50

A receiver is just a special kind of function parameter.
