Arrays are fixed-size groups of variables of the same type.

The type [n]T is an array of n values of type T

To declare an array of 10 integers:

var myInts [10]int

or to declare an initialized literal:
literals are fixed values that remain constant, unlike variables or resources that can change during program execution

primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
