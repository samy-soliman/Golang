/*
A note on GOPATH

The $GOPATH environment variable will be set by default somewhere on your machine (typically in the home directory, ~/go). Since we will be working in the new "Go modules" setup, you don't need to worry about that.
If you read something online about setting up your GOPATH, that documentation is probably out of date.

These days you should avoid working in the $GOPATH/src directory. Again, that's the old way of doing things and can cause unexpected issues, so better to just avoid it.
